            <p>I have been playing music as long as I can remember.  Having been raised in a house where both of my parents were amateur musicians I developed a love of music before I knew how to speak.  I have studied both formally and informally my entire life and cannot live without it.  Some might call me a multi-instrumentalist.  I play the bass, guitar and keyboard mostly these days, though there was once a point where I was in college on a trumpet scholarship.  Be it performance, music apppreciation, music theory or critique, music is my first love and will always help carry me through.</p>

            <p>Is food a hobby? It can be! I do love to eat (no one that sees me will doubt that) but I also love to cook.  I am the more domestic partner in my household so you can often find me in the evenings preparing our meal or find me zoned out on a food blog looking for new ways to prepare an ingredient.  I am also into brewing beer (and drinking it).

            <p>The other hobby that consumes my life is caring for these two wonderful animals.  Samson (left) and Daisy (right) are my solace and the bane of my existence depending on what time of the day you ask me.  Mostly though they are my constant companions and I love them.</p>
